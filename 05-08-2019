Today I didn't get much done. All I did was went to class and fall asleep.
What's worse is I was tired after going to class and tried to sleep with my
head on a table in the CS building. I woke up from my half nap and I forgot
what I did on my computer. I need to start remembering what I did. Anyway after
that I went to lab and felt like I learned about binary and selection sort.
But actually I don't think I even learned much about it. I probably could have
studied more on it before going to lab to make better use of the time. I then
went to the lecture portion, which wasn't very helpful. I go home, eat food, and
start to code. I get distracted and am unable to continue working. My new plan
of action will be to stay at school and just study there for better results.
We'll see how it goes.
