Today I got somethings somewhat done. I went to class, but the professor was
garbage as usual. I didn't learn anything and felt like it was a huge waste
of time. Got my test back though, with Alan's help and my work, I got a 78%
which is I think a B-. After coming home, I cleaned with Lauren. Not sure if 
I should have came home or stayed at school. Then after that I goofed off so
it probably was a TARP to come back. Axle came over soon after then my day was
just over... Better get better at planning my day for coding...
